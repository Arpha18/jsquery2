            What Is Accounting?
             Accounting is the process of recording, classifying and summarizing financial transactions. It provides a clear picture of the financial health of your organization and its performance, which can serve as a catalyst for resource management and strategic growth.
             Accounting is like a powerful machine where you input raw data (figures) and get processed information (financial statements). The whole point is to give you an idea of what’s working and what’s not working so that you can fix it.
             Why Accounting Is Important
             Accounting information exposes your company’s financial performance; it tells whether you’re making a profit or just running into losses at the end of the day.

            This information is not just available to you, but also to external users such as investors, stakeholders and creditors who would want to be enlightened about your business, to figure out whether it’ll be a good choice to invest in and what they can expect in returns.

            Besides playing a key role in providing transparency for stakeholders, accounting also ensures you make informed decisions backed by data.

            Accountant vs. CPA vs. Tax Pro
            In accounting, you’ll come across certain titles which appear to bear similar duties but actually have unique job descriptions. In this section, we’ll briefly review the roles of accountants vs. CPAs and tax professionals.

            An accountant is a professional with a bachelor’s degree who provides financial advice, tax planning and bookkeeping services. They perform various business functions such as the preparation of financial reports, payroll and cash management.

            A certified public accountant (CPA) is a type of professional accountant with more training and experience than a typical accountant. Aspiring CPAs are expected to have a bachelor’s degree, more than two years of public accounting work experience, pass all four parts of the CPA exam and meet additional state-specific qualifications if required. In the U.S., licensed CPAs must have earned their designation from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

            Tax professionals include CPAs, attorneys, accountants, brokers, financial planners and more. Their primary job is to help clients with their taxes so they can avoid paying too much or too little in federal income or state income taxes.

            As a general note, CPAs are considered to be more qualified than tax professionals when it comes to preparing taxes on an individual basis as they are trained to analyze business and personal finances to maximize savings and minimize taxes. It’s also worth noting that while all CPAs are accountants, not all accountants are CPAs.

            Types of Accounting
            Accounting can be broken down into several categories; each category deals with a specific set of information, or documents particular transactions. In this section, we discuss four of the most common branches of accounting:

            Financial Accounting
            This is the practice of recording and reporting financial transactions and cash flows. This type of accounting is particularly needed to generate financial reports for the sake of external individuals and government agencies. These financial statements report the performance and financial health of a business. For example, the balance sheet reports assets and liabilities while the income statement reports revenues and expenses. Financial accounting is governed by accounting rules and regulations such as U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards).

            Managerial Accounting
            This focuses on the use and interpretation of financial information to make sound business decisions. It’s similar to financial accounting, but this time, it’s reserved for internal use, and financial statements are made more frequently to evaluate and interpret financial performance.

            Cost Accounting
            This is the process of tracking, analyzing and understanding the costs involved in a specific business activity. This includes all direct and indirect expenses associated with your business’s day-to-day operations. Cost accounting is particularly important because it helps you ensure that you are spending money on things that benefit your business’s bottom line.

            Tax Accounting
            This is the act of tracking and reporting income and expenses related to your company’s taxes. You don’t want to be in a situation where you have to pay more income tax than is normally required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

            Ways To Manage Your Business Accounting
            So far, we’ve seen the types and benefits of accounting. This leads us to the next question of knowing how to carry out accounting efficiently. There are many ways to manage your business accounting. They include:

            Outsource to Professionals
            You can outsource your accounting work to outside professionals who specialize in bookkeeping and tax preparation. Outsourcing can offer many advantages because it allows you to take advantage of specialized skill sets that may not be available when hiring someone in-house. It’s also flexible and generally costs less.

            Using Accounting Software
            Accounting software allows you to do basic tasks such as tracking inventory, invoicing and payments, and generating reports on sales and expenses. It’s useful for small businesses and freelancers who don’t have the resources to hire an accountant or bookkeeper. Besides, this frees up time so you can focus on running your business smoothly. Check out our recent piece on the best accounting software for small businesses.

            Hiring an In-House Accountant
            You can choose to manage your business accounting by hiring an in-house accountant or CPA. This can be a great option if you want to ensure your books are in order, and that your company’s financial information is accurate, but it does come with some drawbacks. For one thing, the cost of hiring someone like this can be a substantial burden on your business’s finances.
            Effective Accounting Practices To Adopt Immediately
            There are many ways to do accounting, but there are also certain practices that make it easier to keep track of your finances. Some best practices include:

            Keep your personal finances separate from that of your business to get an accurate view of your company’s financial health. This applies a lot to small businesses just getting started with accounting.
            Pay attention to details. Make sure that all transactions are accounted for and properly totaled to facilitate accurate reporting at year-end.
            Hire an accounting professional if you don’t have the time to learn accounting software. This will save you stress and give you the needed time to focus on other important parts of your business.
            Keep adequate records of all assets, liabilities and cash flows for tax purposes. Pay attention to tax laws and regulations. Stay up to date on current news so you can know what’s happening in the financial world.
            Bottom Line
            Accounting is popularly regarded as “the language of business” because it doesn’t just help you keep track of your money, but also helps you make informed decisions about your business. To speed up action, you may hire accounting professionals or purchase accounting software to ensure accurate financial audits and reporting.
            What Is the Purpose of Accounting?
            Accounting is one of the key functions of almost any business. It may be handled by a bookkeeper or an accountant at a small firm, or by sizable finance departments with dozens of employees at larger companies. The reports generated by various streams of accounting, such as cost accounting and managerial accounting, are invaluable in helping management make informed business decisions. 
            The financial statements that summarize a large company's operations, financial position, and cash flows over a particular period are concise and consolidated reports based on thousands of individual financial transactions. As a result, all professional accounting designations are the culmination of years of study and rigorous examinations combined with a minimum number of years of practical accounting experience
            History of Accounting
            The history of accounting has been around almost as long as money itself. Accounting history dates back to ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Babylon. For example, during the Roman Empire, the government had detailed records of its finances.
            2
            However, modern accounting as a profession has only been around since the early 19th century.

            Luca Pacioli is considered "The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping" due to his contributions to the development of accounting as a profession. An Italian mathematician and friend of Leonardo da Vinci, Pacioli published a book on the double-entry system of bookkeeping in 1494.
            3

            By 1880, the modern profession of accounting was fully formed and recognized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
            4
            This institute created many of the systems by which accountants practice today. The formation of the institute occurred in large part due to the Industrial Revolution. Merchants not only needed to track their records but sought to avoid bankruptcy as well.
            What Are the Different Types of Accounting?
            Accountants may be tasked with recording specific transactions or working with specific sets of information. For this reason, there are several broad groups that most accountants can be grouped into.

            Financial Accounting
            Financial accounting refers to the processes used to generate interim and annual financial statements. The results of all financial transactions that occur during an accounting period are summarized in the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. The financial statements of most companies are audited annually by an external CPA firm.

            For some, such as publicly-traded companies, audits are a legal requirement.
            6
            However, lenders also typically require the results of an external audit annually as part of their debt covenants. Therefore, most companies will have annual audits for one reason or another.

            Managerial Accounting 
            Managerial accounting uses much of the same data as financial accounting, but it organizes and utilizes information in different ways. Namely, in managerial accounting, an accountant generates monthly or quarterly reports that a business's management team can use to make decisions about how the business operates. Managerial accounting also encompasses many other facets of accounting, including budgeting, forecasting, and various financial analysis tools. Essentially, any information that may be useful to management falls underneath this umbrella.

            Cost Accounting
            Just as managerial accounting helps businesses make decisions about management, cost accounting helps businesses make decisions about costing. Essentially, cost accounting considers all of the costs related to producing a product. Analysts, managers, business owners, and accountants use this information to determine what their products should cost. In cost accounting, money is cast as an economic factor in production, whereas in financial accounting, money is considered to be a measure of a company's economic performance.

            Tax Accounting
            While financial accountants often use one set of rules to report the financial position of a company, tax accountants often use a different set of rules. These rules are set at the federal, state, or local level based on what return is being filed. Tax accounts balance compliance with reporting rules while also attempting to minimize a company's tax liability through thoughtful strategic decision-making. A tax accountant often oversees the entire tax process of a company: the strategic creation of the organization chart, the operations, the compliance, the reporting, and the remittance of tax liability.
            What Types of Careers Are in the Accounting Field?
            While basic accounting functions can be handled by a bookkeeper, advanced accounting is typically handled by qualified accountants who possess designations such as Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or Certified Management Accountant (CMA) in the United States.
            7
            8

            In Canada, the three legacy designations—the Chartered Accountant (CA), Certified General Accountant (CGA), and Certified Management Accountant (CMA)—have been unified under the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation.
            9

            A major component of the accounting professional is the "Big Four". These four largest accounting firms conduct audit, consulting, tax advisory, and other services. These firms, along with many other smaller firms, comprise the public accounting realm that generally advises financial and tax accounting.

            Careers in accounting may vastly difference by industry, department, and niche. Some relevant job titles may include:

            Auditor (internal or external): ensures compliance with reporting requirements and safeguarding of company assets.
            Forensic Accountant: monitors internal or external activity to investigate the transactions of an individual or business.
            Tax Accountant: strategically plans the optimal business composition to minimize tax liabilities as well as ensures compliance with tax reporting.
            Managerial Accountant: analyzes financial transactions to make thoughtful, strategic recommendations often related to the manufacturing of goods.
            Information and Technology Analyst/Accountant: maintains the system and software in which accounting records are processed and stored.
            Controller: oversees the accounting functions of financial reporting, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and procurement.
